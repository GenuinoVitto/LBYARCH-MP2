# LBYARCH-MP2 - S12  
Members: <br />- Cruz, Mia Bernice<br />- Genuino, Jose Mari Victorio

This is a course requirement for Laboratory Computer Architecture

## Specifications:

Write the kernel in (1) C program and (2) an x86-64 assembly language.  The kernel is to perform a dot product between vector A and vector B and place the result in sdot.

### Required to use functional scalar SIMD registers

### Required to use functional scalar SIMD floating-point instructions

### Input: Scalar variable n (integer) contains the length of the vector;  Vectors A and B are both single-precision float. Scalar sdot is a single-precision float.

### Output: store the result in memory location sdot.  Display the result for all versions of the kernel (i.e., C and  x86-64).
